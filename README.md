## Description:
  ***Is your neighborhood accessible?*** At the core of cities' functionality and accessibilty is land use, and the tool that the team has made can help determine that. According to this [article](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2020/02/20-minute-neighborhoods-could-solve-many-of-dallas-urban-problems/) by Peter Simek, the idea of measuring a city' accessibility by how many things can be found within a 20 min walk or bike ride is an approach that global major cities such as Paris, Portland, Melbourne, and Barcelona are looking into. It is more sustainable and a solution to many urban settlement challenges such as rising gas and energy costs, transportation costs and more. 
## Our solution:
  The team built an evalutation tool in Python using Googlemaps python library to find the places within a 20 minute walk or bike ride. These places include hospitals, pharmacies, grocery stores, all basic need providers. This tool can be used to determine if a neighborhood is accessible by determining how many of these places are available in a 20 min range.
